# Oozie UI

## Development environment

Inside oozie-ui/ directory, you can run several commands:

```bash
  # Starts the development server.
  npm start

  # Bundles the app into static files for production.
  npm run build

  # Starts the test runner.
  npm test

  # Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  # and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
  npm run eject
```

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```bash
  cd oozie-ui
  npm start
```

Happy hacking!
