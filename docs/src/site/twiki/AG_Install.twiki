---+!! Oozie Installation and Configuration

%TOC%

---++ Basic Setup

Follow the instructions at [[DG_QuickStart][Oozie Quick Start]].

---++ Environment Setup

*IMPORTANT:* Oozie ignores any set value for =OOZIE_HOME=, Oozie computes its home automatically.

When running Oozie with its embedded Tomcat server, the =conf/oozie-env.sh= file can be
used to configure the following environment variables used by Oozie:

*CATALINA_OPTS* : settings for the Embedded Tomcat that runs Oozie Java System properties
for Oozie should be specified in this variable. No default value.

*OOZIE_CONFIG_FILE* : Oozie configuration file to load from Oozie configuration directory.
Default value =oozie-site.xml=.

*OOZIE_LOGS* : Oozie logs directory. Default value =logs/= directory in the Oozie installation
directory.

*OOZIE_LOG4J_FILE* :  Oozie Log4J configuration file to load from Oozie configuration directory.
Default value =oozie-log4j.properties=.

*OOZIE_LOG4J_RELOAD* : Reload interval of the Log4J configuration file, in seconds.
Default value =10=

*OOZIE_HTTP_PORT* : The port Oozie server runs. Default value =11000=.

*OOZIE_ADMIN_PORT* : The admin port Oozie server runs. Default value =11001=.

*OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME* : The host name Oozie server runs on. Default value is the output of the
command =hostname -f=.

*OOZIE_BASE_URL* : The base URL for actions callback URLs to Oozie. The default value
is =http://${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}:${OOZIE_HTTP_PORT}/oozie=.

*OOZIE_CHECK_OWNER* : If set to =true=, Oozie setup/start/run/stop scripts will check that the
owner of the Oozie installation directory matches the user invoking the script. The default
value is undefined and interpreted as a =false=.

---++ Oozie Server Setup

The =oozie-setup.sh= script prepares the embedded Tomcat server to run Oozie.

The =oozie-setup.sh= script options are:

<verbatim>
Usage  : oozie-setup.sh <OPTIONS>"
         prepare-war [-hadoop HADOOP_VERSION HADOOP_PATH] [-extjs EXTJS_PATH] [-jars JARS_PATH]"
                     (prepare-war is to prepare war files for oozie)"
                     (Hadoop version [0.20.1|0.20.2|0.20.104|0.20.200|0.23.x|2.x] and Hadoop install dir)"
                     (EXTJS_PATH is expanded or ZIP, to enable the Oozie webconsole)"
                     (JARS_PATH is multiple JAR path separated by ':')"
         sharelib create -fs FS_URI [-locallib SHARED_LIBRARY] (create sharelib for oozie,"
                                                               FS_URI is the fs.default.name"
                                                               for hdfs uri; SHARED_LIBRARY, path to the"
                                                               Oozie sharelib to install, it can be a tarball"
                                                               or an expanded version of it. If ommited,"
                                                               the Oozie sharelib tarball from the Oozie"
                                                               installation directory will be used)"
                                                               (action failes if sharelib is already installed"
                                                               in HDFS)"
         sharelib upgrade -fs FS_URI [-locallib SHARED_LIBRARY] (upgrade existing sharelib, fails if there"
                                                                 is no existing sharelib installed in HDFS)"
         (without options prints usage information)"
</verbatim>

If a directory =libext/= is present in Oozie installation directory, the =oozie-setup.sh= script
include all JARs in the =libext/= directory in Oozie WAR file.

If the ExtJS ZIP file is present in the =libext/= directory, it will be added to Oozie WAR as well.
The ExtJS library file name be =ext-2.2.zip=.

---+++ Setting Up Oozie with an Alternate Tomcat

Use the =addtowar.sh= script to prepare the Oozie server only if Oozie will run with a different
servlet  container than the embedded Tomcat provided with the distribution.

The =addtowar.sh= script adds Hadoop JARs, JDBC JARs and the ExtJS library to the Oozie WAR file.

The =addtowar.sh= script options are:

<verbatim>
 Usage  : addtowar <OPTIONS>
 Options: -inputwar INPUT_OOZIE_WAR
          -outputwar OUTPUT_OOZIE_WAR
          [-hadoop HADOOP_VERSION HADOOP_PATH]
          [-extjs EXTJS_PATH]
          [-jars JARS_PATH] (multiple JAR path separated by ':')
</verbatim>

The original =oozie.war= file is in the Oozie server installation directory.

After the Hadoop JARs and the ExtJS library has been added to the =oozie.war= file Oozie is ready to run.

Delete any previous deployment of the =oozie.war= from the servlet container (if using Tomcat, delete
=oozie.war= and =oozie= directory from Tomcat's =webapps/= directory)

Deploy the prepared =oozie.war= file (the one that contains the Hadoop JARs adn the ExtJS library) in the
servlet container (if using Tomcat, copy the prepared =oozie.war= file to Tomcat's =webapps/= directory).

*IMPORTANT:* Only one Oozie instance can be deployed per Tomcat instance.

---++ Database Configuration

Oozie works with HSQL, Derby, MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL databases.

By default, Oozie is configured to use Embedded Derby.

Oozie bundles the JDBC drivers for HSQL, Embedded Derby and PostgreSQL.

HSQL is normally used for testcases as it is an in-memory database and all data is lost everytime Oozie is stopped.

If using Derby, MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL, the Oozie database schema must be created using the =ooziedb.sh= command
line tool.

If using MySQL or Oracle, the corresponding JDBC driver JAR file mut be copied to Oozie's =libext/= directory and
it must be added to Oozie WAR file using the =bin/addtowar.sh= or the =oozie-setup.sh= scripts using the =-jars= option.

The SQL database used by Oozie is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.db.schema.name=oozie
  oozie.service.JPAService.create.db.schema=false
  oozie.service.JPAService.validate.db.connection=false
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.url=jdbc:derby:${oozie.data.dir}/${oozie.db.schema.name}-db;create=true
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.username=sa
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.password=
  oozie.service.JPAService.pool.max.active.conn=10
</verbatim>

*NOTE:* If the =oozie.db.schema.create= property is set to =true= (default value is =false=) the Oozie tables
will be created automatically without having to use the =ooziedb= command line tool. Setting this property to
 =true= it is recommended only for development.

*NOTE:* If the =oozie.db.schema.create= property is set to true, the =oozie.service.JPAService.validate.db.connection=
property value is ignored and Oozie handles it as set to =false=.

Once =oozie-site.xml= has been configured with the database configuration execute the =ooziedb.sh= command line tool to
create the database:

<verbatim>
$ bin/ooziedb.sh create -sqlfile oozie.sql -run

Validate DB Connection.
DONE
Check DB schema does not exist
DONE
Check OOZIE_SYS table does not exist
DONE
Create SQL schema
DONE
DONE
Create OOZIE_SYS table
DONE

Oozie DB has been created for Oozie version '3.2.0'

The SQL commands have been written to: oozie.sql

$
</verbatim>

NOTE: If using MySQL or Oracle, copy the corresponding JDBC driver JAR file to the =libext/= directory before running
the =ooziedb.sh= command line tool.

NOTE: If instead using the '-run' option, the '-sqlfile <FILE>' option is used, then all the
database changes will be written to the specified file and the database won't be modified.

If using HSQL there is no need to use the =ooziedb= command line tool as HSQL is an im-memory database. Use the
following configuration properties in the oozie-site.xml:

<verbatim>
  oozie.db.schema.name=oozie
  oozie.service.JPAService.create.db.schema=true
  oozie.service.JPAService.validate.db.connection=false
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.driver=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:${oozie.db.schema.name}
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.username=sa
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.password=
  oozie.service.JPAService.pool.max.active.conn=10
</verbatim>

---++ Oozie Configuration

By default, Oozie configuration is read from Oozie's =conf/= directory

The Oozie configuration is distributed in 3 different files:

   * =oozie-site.xml= : Oozie server configuration
   * =oozie-log4j.properties= : Oozie logging configuration
   * =adminusers.txt= : Oozie admin users list

---+++ Oozie Configuration Properties

All Oozie configuration properties and their default values are defined in the =oozie-default.xml= file.

Oozie resolves configuration property values in the following order:

   * If a Java System property is defined, it uses its value
   * Else, if the Oozie configuration file (=oozie-site.xml=) contains the property, it uses its value
   * Else, it uses the default value documented in the =oozie-default.xml= file

*NOTE:* The =oozie-default.xml= file found in Oozie's =conf/= directory is not used by Oozie, it is there
for reference purposes only.

---+++ Logging Configuration

By default, Oozie log configuration is defined in the =oozie-log4j.properties= configuration file.

If the Oozie log configuration file changes, Oozie reloads the new settings automatically.

By default, Oozie logs to Oozie's =logs/= directory.

Oozie logs in 4 different files:

   * oozie.log: web services log streaming works from this log
   * oozie-ops.log: messages for Admin/Operations to monitor
   * oozie-instrumentation.log: intrumentation data, every 60 seconds (configurable)
   * oozie-audit.log: audit messages, workflow jobs changes

The embedded Tomcat and embedded Derby log files are also written to Oozie's =logs/= directory.

---+++ Oozie User Authentication Configuration

Oozie supports Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication, pseudo/simple authentication and anonymous access
for client connections.

Anonymous access (*default*) does not require the user to authenticate and the user ID is obtained from
the job properties on job submission operations, other operations are anonymous.

Pseudo/simple authentication requires the user to specify the user name on the request, this is done by
the PseudoAuthenticator class by injecting the =user.name= parameter in the query string of all requests.
The =user.name= parameter value is taken from the client process Java System property =user.name=.

Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication requires the user to perform a Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication sequence.

If Pseudo/simple or Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication mechanisms are used, Oozie will return the user an
authentication token HTTP Cookie that can be used in later requests as identy proof.

Oozie uses Apache Hadoop-Auth (Java HTTP SPENGO) library for authentication.
This library can be extended to support other authentication mechanisms.

Oozie user authentication is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.authentication.type=simple
  oozie.authentication.token.validity=36000
  oozie.authentication.signature.secret=
  oozie.authentication.cookie.domain=
  oozie.authentication.simple.anonymous.allowed=true
  oozie.authentication.kerberos.principal=HTTP/localhost@${local.realm}
  oozie.authentication.kerberos.keytab=${oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file}
</verbatim>

The =type= defines authentication used for Oozie HTTP endpoint, the supported values are:
simple | kerberos | #AUTHENTICATION_HANDLER_CLASSNAME#.

The =token.validity= indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
to be renewed.

The =signature.secret= is the signature secret for signing the authentication tokens. If not set a random
secret is generated at startup time.

The =oozie.authentication.cookie.domain= The domain to use for the HTTP cookie that stores the
authentication token. In order to authentiation to work correctly across all Hadoop nodes web-consoles
the domain must be correctly set.

The =simple.anonymous.allowed= indicates if anonymous requests are allowed. This setting is meaningful
only when using 'simple' authentication.

The =kerberos.principal= indicates the Kerberos principal to be used for HTTP endpoint.
The principal MUST start with 'HTTP/' as per Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO specification.

The =kerberos.keytab= indicates the location of the keytab file with the credentials for the principal.
It should be the same keytab file Oozie uses for its Kerberos credentials for Hadoop.

---+++ Oozie Hadoop Authentication Configuration

Oozie works with Hadoop versions which support Kerberos authentication.

Oozie Hadoop authentication is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.enabled=false
  local.realm=LOCALHOST
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file=${user.home}/oozie.keytab
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.principal=${user.name}/localhost@{local.realm}
</verbatim>

The above default values are for a Hadoop 0.20 secure distribution (with support for Kerberos authentication).

To enable Kerberos authentication, the following property must be set:

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.enabled=true
</verbatim>

When using Kerberos authentication, the following properties must be set to the correct values (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  local.realm=LOCALHOST
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file=${user.home}/oozie.keytab
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.principal=${user.name}/localhost@{local.realm}
</verbatim>

*IMPORTANT:* When using Oozie with a Hadoop 20 with Security distribution, the Oozie user in Hadoop must be configured
as a proxy user.

---+++ User ProxyUser Configuration

Oozie supports impersonation or proxyuser functionality (identical to Hadoop proxyuser capabilities and conceptually
similar to Unix 'sudo').

Proxyuser enables other systems that are Oozie clients to submit jobs on behalf of other users.

Because proxyuser is a powerful capability, Oozie provides the following restriction capabilities
(similar to Hadoop):

   * Proxyuser is an explicit configuration on per proxyuser user basis.
   * A proxyuser user can be restricted to impersonate other users from a set of hosts.
   * A proxyser user can be restricted to impersonate users belonging to a set of groups.

There are 2 configuration properties needed to set up a proxyuser:

   * oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.#USER#.hosts: hosts from where the user #USER# can impersonate other users.
   * oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.#USER#.groups: groups the users being impersonated by user #USER# must belong to.

Both properties support the '*' wildcard as value. Although this is recommended only for testing/development.

---+++ User Authorization Configuration

Oozie has a basic authorization model:

   * Users have read access to all jobs
   * Users have write access to their own jobs
   * Users have write access to jobs based on an Access Control List (list of users and groups)
   * Users have read access to admin operations
   * Admin users have write access to all jobs
   * Admin users have write access to admin operations

If security is disabled all users are admin users.

Oozie security is set via the following configuration property (default value shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.AuthorizationService.security.enabled=false
</verbatim>

NOTE: the old ACL model where a group was provided is still supported if the following property is set
in =oozie-site.xml=:

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.AuthorizationService.default.group.as.acl=true
</verbatim>

Admin users are determined from the list of admin groups, specified in
 =oozie.service.AuthorizationService.admin.groups= property. Use commas to separate multiple groups, spaces, tabs
and ENTER characters are trimmed.

If the above property for admin groups is not set, then the admin users are the users specified in the
 =conf/adminusers.txt= file. The syntax of this file is:

   * One user name per line
   * Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored

---+++ Oozie System ID Configuration

Oozie has a system ID that is is used to generate the Oozie temporary runtime directory, the workflow job IDs, and the
workflow action IDs.

Two Oozie systems running with the same ID will not have any conflict but in case of troubleshooting it will be easier
to identify resources created/used by the different Oozie systems if they have different system IDs (default value
shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.system.id=oozie-${user.name}
</verbatim>

---+++ Filesystem Configuration

Oozie lets you to configure the allowed Filesystems by using the following configuration property in oozie-site.xml:
<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.supported.filesystems</name>
    <value>hdfs</value>
  </property>
</verbatim>

The above value, =hdfs=, which is the default, means that Oozie will only allow HDFS filesystems to be used.  Examples of other
filesystems that Oozie is compatible with are: hdfs, hftp, webhdfs, and viewfs.  Multiple filesystems can be specified as
comma-separated values.  Putting a * will allow any filesystem type, effectively disabling this check.

---+++ HCatalog Configuration

Refer to the [[DG_HCatalogIntegration][Oozie HCatalog Integration]] document for a overview of HCatalog and
integration of Oozie with HCatalog. This section explains the various settings to be configured in oozie-site.xml on
the Oozie server to enable Oozie to work with HCatalog.

*Adding HCatalog jars to Oozie war:*

 For Oozie server to talk to HCatalog server, HCatalog and hive jars need to be in the server classpath.
hive-site.xml which has the configuration to talk to the HCatalog server also needs to be in the classpath.

The oozie-[version]-hcataloglibs.tar.gz in the oozie distribution bundles the required hcatalog and hive jars that
needs to be placed in the Oozie server classpath. If using a version of HCatalog bundled in
Oozie hcataloglibs/, copy the corresponding HCatalog jars from hcataloglibs/ to the libext/ directory. If using a
different version of HCatalog, copy the required HCatalog jars from such version in the libext/ directory.
This needs to be done before running the =oozie-setup.sh= script so that these jars get added to the Oozie WAR file.

*Configure HCatalog URI Handling:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.URIHandlerService.uri.handlers</name>
    <value>org.apache.oozie.dependency.FSURIHandler,org.apache.oozie.dependency.HCatURIHandler</value>
    <description>
        Enlist the different uri handlers supported for data availability checks.
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

The above configuration defines the different uri handlers which check for existence of data dependencies defined in a
Coordinator. The default value is =org.apache.oozie.dependency.FSURIHandler=. FSURIHandler supports uris with
schemes defined in the configuration =oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.supported.filesystems= which are hdfs, hftp
and webhcat by default. HCatURIHandler supports uris with the scheme as hcat.

*Configure HCatalog services:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.services.ext</name>
    <value>
        org.apache.oozie.service.JMSAccessorService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.PartitionDependencyManagerService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.HCatAccessorService
      </value>
    <description>
          To add/replace services defined in 'oozie.services' with custom implementations.
          Class names must be separated by commas.
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

PartitionDependencyManagerService and HCatAccessorService are required to work with HCatalog and support Coordinators
having HCatalog uris as data dependency. If the HCatalog server is configured to publish partition availability
notifications to a JMS compliant messaging provider like ActiveMQ, then JMSAccessorService needs to be added
to =oozie.services.ext= to handle those notifications.

*Configure JMS Provider JNDI connection mapping for HCatalog:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.HCatAccessorService.jmsconnections</name>
    <value>
      hcat://hcatserver.colo1.com:8020=java.naming.factory.initial#Dummy.Factory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.colo1.com:61616,
      default=java.naming.factory.initial#org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.colo.com:61616;connectionFactoryNames#ConnectionFactory
    </value>
    <description>
        Specify the map  of endpoints to JMS configuration properties. In general, endpoint
        identifies the HCatalog server URL. "default" is used if no endpoint is mentioned
        in the query. If some JMS property is not defined, the system will use the property
        defined jndi.properties. jndi.properties files is retrieved from the application classpath.
        Mapping rules can also be provided for mapping Hcatalog servers to corresponding JMS providers.
        hcat://${1}.${2}.com:8020=java.naming.factory.initial#Dummy.Factory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.${2}.com:61616
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

  Currently HCatalog does not provide APIs to get the connection details to connect to the JMS Provider it publishes
notifications to. It only has APIs which provide the topic name in the JMS Provider to which the notifications are
published for a given database table. So the JMS Provider's connection properties needs to be manually configured
in Oozie using the above setting. You can either provide a =default= JNDI configuration which will be used as the
JMS Provider for all HCatalog servers, or can specify a configuration per HCatalog server URL or provide a
configuration based on a rule matching multiple HCatalog server URLs. For example: With the configuration of
hcat://${1}.${2}.com:8020=java.naming.factory.initial#Dummy.Factory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.${2}.com:61616,
request URL of hcat://server1.colo1.com:8020 will map to tcp://broker.colo1.com:61616, hcat://server2.colo2.com:8020
will map to tcp://broker.colo2.com:61616 and so on.

*Configure HCatalog Polling Frequency:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.coord.push.check.requeue.interval
        </name>
    <value>600000</value>
    <description>Command re-queue interval for push dependencies (in millisecond).
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

  If there is no JMS Provider configured for a HCatalog Server, then oozie polls HCatalog based on the frequency defined
in =oozie.service.coord.input.check.requeue.interval=. This config also applies to HDFS polling.
If there is a JMS provider configured for a HCatalog Server, then oozie polls HCatalog based on the frequency defined
in =oozie.service.coord.push.check.requeue.interval= as a fallback.
The defaults for =oozie.service.coord.input.check.requeue.interval= and =oozie.service.coord.push.check.requeue.interval=
are 1 minute and 10 minutes respectively.

---+++ Fine Tuning an Oozie Server

Refer to the [[./oozie-default.xml][oozie-default.xml]] for details.

---++ Starting and Stopping Oozie

Use the standard Tomcat commands to start and stop Oozie.

---++ Oozie Command Line Installation

Copy and expand the =oozie-client= TAR.GZ file bundled with the distribution. Add the =bin/= directory to the =PATH=.

Refer to the [[DG_CommandLineTool][Command Line Interface Utilities]] document for a a full reference of the =oozie=
command line tool.

---++ Oozie Share Lib

The Oozie share lib TAR.GZ file bundled with the distribution contains the necessary files to run Oozie map-reduce
streaming and pig actions.

The bundled Streaming and Pig JARs are the ones used by Oozie testcases.

---++ Oozie Coordinators/Bundles Processing Timezone

By default Oozie runs coordinator and bundle jobs using =UTC= timezone for datetime values specified in the application
XML and in the job parameter properties. This includes coordinator applications start and end times of jobs, coordinator
datasets initial-instance, bundle applications kick-offtimes. In addition, coordinator dataset instance URI templates
will be resolved using datetime values of the Oozie processing timezone.

It is possible to set the Oozie processing timezone to a timezone that is an offset of UTC, alternate timezones must
expressed in using a GMT offset ( =GMT+/-####= ). For example: =GMT+0530= (India timezone).

To change the default =UTC= timezone, use the =oozie.processing.timezone= property in the =oozie-site.xml=. For example:

<verbatim>
<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>oozie.processing.timezone</name>
        <value>GMT+0530</value>
    </property>
</configuration>
</verbatim>

*IMPORTANT:* If using a processing timezone other than =UTC=, all datetime values in coordinator and bundle jobs must
be expressed in the corresponding timezone, for example =2012-08-08T12:42+0530=.

*NOTE:* It is strongly encouraged to use =UTC=, the default Oozie processing timezone.

For more details on using an alternate Oozie processing timezone, please reffer to the
[[CoordinatorFunctionalSpec#datetime][Coordinator Fuctional Specification, section '4. Datetime']]

#UberJar
---++ MapReduce Workflow Uber Jars
For Map-Reduce jobs (not including streaming or pipes), additional jar files can also be included via an uber jar. An uber jar is a
jar file that contains additional jar files within a "lib" folder (see
[[WorkflowFunctionalSpec#AppDeployment][Workflow Functional Specification]] for more information). Submitting a workflow with an uber jar
requires at least Hadoop 2.2.0 or 1.2.0. As such, using uber jars in a workflow is disabled by default. To enable this feature, use
the =oozie.action.mapreduce.uber.jar.enable= property in the =oozie-site.xml= (and make sure to use a supported version of Hadoop).

<verbatim>
<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>oozie.action.mapreduce.uber.jar.enable</name>
        <value>true</value>
    </property>
</configuration>
</verbatim>


---++ Advanced/Custom Environment Settings

Oozie can be configured to use Unix standard filesystem hierarchy for its different files
(configuration, logs, data and temporary files).

These settings must be done in the =bin/oozie-env.sh= script.

This script is sourced before the configuration =oozie-env.sh= and supports additional
environment variables (shown with their default values):

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_CONFIG=${OOZIE_HOME}/conf
export OOZIE_DATA={OOZIE_HOME}/data
export OOZIE_LOG={OOZIE_HOME}/logs
export CATALINA_BASE=${OOZIE_HOME}/oozie-server
export CATALINA_TMPDIR=${OOZIE_HOME}/oozie-server/temp
export CATALINA_OUT=${OOZIE_LOGS}/catalina.out
export CATALINA_PID=/tmp/oozie.pid
</verbatim>

Sample values to make Oozie follow Unix standard filesystem hierarchy:

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_CONFIG=/etc/oozie
