---+!! Oozie Installation and Configuration

%TOC%

---++ Basic Setup

Follow the instructions at [[DG_QuickStart][Oozie Quick Start]].

---++ Environment Setup

*IMPORTANT:* Oozie ignores any set value for =OOZIE_HOME=, Oozie computes its home automatically.

When running Oozie with its embedded Tomcat server, the =conf/oozie-env.sh= file can be
used to configure the following environment variables used by Oozie:

*CATALINA_OPTS* : settings for the Embedded Tomcat that runs Oozie Java System properties
for Oozie should be specified in this variable. No default value.

*OOZIE_CONFIG_FILE* : Oozie configuration file to load from Oozie configuration directory.
Default value =oozie-site.xml=.

*OOZIE_LOGS* : Oozie logs directory. Default value =logs/= directory in the Oozie installation
directory.

*OOZIE_LOG4J_FILE* :  Oozie Log4J configuration file to load from Oozie configuration directory.
Default value =oozie-log4j.properties=.

*OOZIE_LOG4J_RELOAD* : Reload interval of the Log4J configuration file, in seconds.
Default value =10=

*OOZIE_HTTP_PORT* : The port Oozie server runs. Default value =11000=.

*OOZIE_ADMIN_PORT* : The admin port Oozie server runs. Default value =11001=.

*OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME* : The host name Oozie server runs on. Default value is the output of the
command =hostname -f=.

*OOZIE_BASE_URL* : The base URL for actions callback URLs to Oozie. The default value
is =http://${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}:${OOZIE_HTTP_PORT}/oozie=.

*OOZIE_CHECK_OWNER* : If set to =true=, Oozie setup/start/run/stop scripts will check that the
owner of the Oozie installation directory matches the user invoking the script. The default
value is undefined and interpreted as a =false=.

If Oozie is configured to use HTTPS (SSL), then the following environment variables are also used:

*OOZIE_HTTPS_PORT* : The port Oozie server runs when using HTTPS. Default value =11443=.

*OOZIE_HTTPS_KEYSTORE_FILE* : The location of the keystore file containing the certificate information.
Default value =${HOME}/.keystore= (i.e. the home dir of the Oozie user).

*OOZIE_HTTPS_KEYSTORE_PASS* : The password of the keystore file. Default value =password=.

*OOZIE_INSTANCE_ID* : The instance id of the Oozie server.  When using HA, each server instance should have a unique instance id.
Default value =${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}=

---++ Oozie Server Setup

The =oozie-setup.sh= script prepares the embedded Tomcat server to run Oozie.

The =oozie-setup.sh= script options are:

<verbatim>
Usage  : oozie-setup.sh <OPTIONS>"
         prepare-war [-d directory] [-secure] (-d identifies an alternative directory for processing jars"
                                              -secure will configure the war file to use HTTPS (SSL))"
         sharelib create -fs FS_URI [-locallib SHARED_LIBRARY] (create sharelib for oozie,"

                                                               or an expanded version of it. If ommited,"
                                                               the Oozie sharelib tarball from the Oozie"
                                                               installation directory will be used)"
                                                               (action failes if sharelib is already installed"
                                                               in HDFS)"
         sharelib upgrade -fs FS_URI [-locallib SHARED_LIBRARY] ([deprecated][use create command to create new version]

                                                                 is no existing sharelib installed in HDFS)"
         db create|upgrade|postupgrade -run [-sqlfile <FILE>] (create, upgrade or postupgrade oozie db with an"
                                                               optional sql file)"
         (without options prints usage information)"
</verbatim>

If a directory =libext/= is present in Oozie installation directory, the =oozie-setup.sh= script
include all JARs in the =libext/= directory in Oozie WAR file.

If the ExtJS ZIP file is present in the =libext/= directory, it will be added to Oozie WAR as well.
The ExtJS library file name be =ext-2.2.zip=.

---+++ Setting Up Oozie with an Alternate Tomcat

Use the =addtowar.sh= script to prepare the Oozie server only if Oozie will run with a different
servlet  container than the embedded Tomcat provided with the distribution.

The =addtowar.sh= script adds Hadoop JARs, JDBC JARs and the ExtJS library to the Oozie WAR file.

The =addtowar.sh= script options are:

<verbatim>
 Usage  : addtowar <OPTIONS>
 Options: -inputwar INPUT_OOZIE_WAR
          -outputwar OUTPUT_OOZIE_WAR
          [-hadoop HADOOP_VERSION HADOOP_PATH]
          [-extjs EXTJS_PATH]
          [-jars JARS_PATH] (multiple JAR path separated by ':')
          [-secureWeb WEB_XML_PATH] (path to secure web.xml)
</verbatim>

The original =oozie.war= file is in the Oozie server installation directory.

After the Hadoop JARs and the ExtJS library has been added to the =oozie.war= file Oozie is ready to run.

Delete any previous deployment of the =oozie.war= from the servlet container (if using Tomcat, delete
=oozie.war= and =oozie= directory from Tomcat's =webapps/= directory)

Deploy the prepared =oozie.war= file (the one that contains the Hadoop JARs adn the ExtJS library) in the
servlet container (if using Tomcat, copy the prepared =oozie.war= file to Tomcat's =webapps/= directory).

*IMPORTANT:* Only one Oozie instance can be deployed per Tomcat instance.

---++ Database Configuration

Oozie works with HSQL, Derby, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL or SQL Server databases.

By default, Oozie is configured to use Embedded Derby.

Oozie bundles the JDBC drivers for HSQL, Embedded Derby and PostgreSQL.

HSQL is normally used for testcases as it is an in-memory database and all data is lost everytime Oozie is stopped.

If using Derby, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, the Oozie database schema must be created using the =ooziedb.sh= command
line tool.

If using MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server, the corresponding JDBC driver JAR file mut be copied to Oozie's =libext/= directory and
it must be added to Oozie WAR file using the =bin/addtowar.sh= or the =oozie-setup.sh= scripts using the =-jars= option.

The SQL database used by Oozie is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.db.schema.name=oozie
  oozie.service.JPAService.create.db.schema=false
  oozie.service.JPAService.validate.db.connection=false
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.url=jdbc:derby:${oozie.data.dir}/${oozie.db.schema.name}-db;create=true
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.username=sa
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.password=
  oozie.service.JPAService.pool.max.active.conn=10
</verbatim>

*NOTE:* If the =oozie.db.schema.create= property is set to =true= (default value is =false=) the Oozie tables
will be created automatically without having to use the =ooziedb= command line tool. Setting this property to
 =true= it is recommended only for development.

*NOTE:* If the =oozie.db.schema.create= property is set to true, the =oozie.service.JPAService.validate.db.connection=
property value is ignored and Oozie handles it as set to =false=.

Once =oozie-site.xml= has been configured with the database configuration execute the =ooziedb.sh= command line tool to
create the database:

<verbatim>
$ bin/ooziedb.sh create -sqlfile oozie.sql -run

Validate DB Connection.
DONE
Check DB schema does not exist
DONE
Check OOZIE_SYS table does not exist
DONE
Create SQL schema
DONE
DONE
Create OOZIE_SYS table
DONE

Oozie DB has been created for Oozie version '3.2.0'

The SQL commands have been written to: oozie.sql

$
</verbatim>

NOTE: If using MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server, copy the corresponding JDBC driver JAR file to the =libext/= directory before running
the =ooziedb.sh= command line tool.

NOTE: If instead using the '-run' option, the '-sqlfile <FILE>' option is used, then all the
database changes will be written to the specified file and the database won't be modified.

If using HSQL there is no need to use the =ooziedb= command line tool as HSQL is an im-memory database. Use the
following configuration properties in the oozie-site.xml:

<verbatim>
  oozie.db.schema.name=oozie
  oozie.service.JPAService.create.db.schema=true
  oozie.service.JPAService.validate.db.connection=false
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.driver=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:${oozie.db.schema.name}
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.username=sa
  oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.password=
  oozie.service.JPAService.pool.max.active.conn=10
</verbatim>

---++ Oozie Configuration

By default, Oozie configuration is read from Oozie's =conf/= directory

The Oozie configuration is distributed in 3 different files:

   * =oozie-site.xml= : Oozie server configuration
   * =oozie-log4j.properties= : Oozie logging configuration
   * =adminusers.txt= : Oozie admin users list

---+++ Oozie Configuration Properties

All Oozie configuration properties and their default values are defined in the =oozie-default.xml= file.

Oozie resolves configuration property values in the following order:

   * If a Java System property is defined, it uses its value
   * Else, if the Oozie configuration file (=oozie-site.xml=) contains the property, it uses its value
   * Else, it uses the default value documented in the =oozie-default.xml= file

*NOTE:* The =oozie-default.xml= file found in Oozie's =conf/= directory is not used by Oozie, it is there
for reference purposes only.

---+++ Logging Configuration

By default, Oozie log configuration is defined in the =oozie-log4j.properties= configuration file.

If the Oozie log configuration file changes, Oozie reloads the new settings automatically.

By default, Oozie logs to Oozie's =logs/= directory.

Oozie logs in 4 different files:

   * oozie.log: web services log streaming works from this log
   * oozie-ops.log: messages for Admin/Operations to monitor
   * oozie-instrumentation.log: intrumentation data, every 60 seconds (configurable)
   * oozie-audit.log: audit messages, workflow jobs changes

The embedded Tomcat and embedded Derby log files are also written to Oozie's =logs/= directory.

---+++ Oozie User Authentication Configuration

Oozie supports Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication, pseudo/simple authentication and anonymous access
for client connections.

Anonymous access (*default*) does not require the user to authenticate and the user ID is obtained from
the job properties on job submission operations, other operations are anonymous.

Pseudo/simple authentication requires the user to specify the user name on the request, this is done by
the PseudoAuthenticator class by injecting the =user.name= parameter in the query string of all requests.
The =user.name= parameter value is taken from the client process Java System property =user.name=.

Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication requires the user to perform a Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication sequence.

If Pseudo/simple or Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication mechanisms are used, Oozie will return the user an
authentication token HTTP Cookie that can be used in later requests as identy proof.

Oozie uses Apache Hadoop-Auth (Java HTTP SPENGO) library for authentication.
This library can be extended to support other authentication mechanisms.

Oozie user authentication is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.authentication.type=simple
  oozie.authentication.token.validity=36000
  oozie.authentication.signature.secret=
  oozie.authentication.cookie.domain=
  oozie.authentication.simple.anonymous.allowed=true
  oozie.authentication.kerberos.principal=HTTP/localhost@${local.realm}
  oozie.authentication.kerberos.keytab=${oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file}
</verbatim>

The =type= defines authentication used for Oozie HTTP endpoint, the supported values are:
simple | kerberos | #AUTHENTICATION_HANDLER_CLASSNAME#.

The =token.validity= indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
to be renewed.

The =signature.secret= is the signature secret for signing the authentication tokens. If not set a random
secret is generated at startup time.

The =oozie.authentication.cookie.domain= The domain to use for the HTTP cookie that stores the
authentication token. In order to authentiation to work correctly across all Hadoop nodes web-consoles
the domain must be correctly set.

The =simple.anonymous.allowed= indicates if anonymous requests are allowed. This setting is meaningful
only when using 'simple' authentication.

The =kerberos.principal= indicates the Kerberos principal to be used for HTTP endpoint.
The principal MUST start with 'HTTP/' as per Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO specification.

The =kerberos.keytab= indicates the location of the keytab file with the credentials for the principal.
It should be the same keytab file Oozie uses for its Kerberos credentials for Hadoop.

---+++ Oozie Hadoop Authentication Configuration

Oozie works with Hadoop versions which support Kerberos authentication.

Oozie Hadoop authentication is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.enabled=false
  local.realm=LOCALHOST
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file=${user.home}/oozie.keytab
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.principal=${user.name}/localhost@{local.realm}
</verbatim>

The above default values are for a Hadoop 0.20 secure distribution (with support for Kerberos authentication).

To enable Kerberos authentication, the following property must be set:

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.enabled=true
</verbatim>

When using Kerberos authentication, the following properties must be set to the correct values (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  local.realm=LOCALHOST
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file=${user.home}/oozie.keytab
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.principal=${user.name}/localhost@{local.realm}
</verbatim>

*IMPORTANT:* When using Oozie with a Hadoop 20 with Security distribution, the Oozie user in Hadoop must be configured
as a proxy user.

---+++ User ProxyUser Configuration

Oozie supports impersonation or proxyuser functionality (identical to Hadoop proxyuser capabilities and conceptually
similar to Unix 'sudo').

Proxyuser enables other systems that are Oozie clients to submit jobs on behalf of other users.

Because proxyuser is a powerful capability, Oozie provides the following restriction capabilities
(similar to Hadoop):

   * Proxyuser is an explicit configuration on per proxyuser user basis.
   * A proxyuser user can be restricted to impersonate other users from a set of hosts.
   * A proxyser user can be restricted to impersonate users belonging to a set of groups.

There are 2 configuration properties needed to set up a proxyuser:

   * oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.#USER#.hosts: hosts from where the user #USER# can impersonate other users.
   * oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.#USER#.groups: groups the users being impersonated by user #USER# must belong to.

Both properties support the '*' wildcard as value. Although this is recommended only for testing/development.

---+++ User Authorization Configuration

Oozie has a basic authorization model:

   * Users have read access to all jobs
   * Users have write access to their own jobs
   * Users have write access to jobs based on an Access Control List (list of users and groups)
   * Users have read access to admin operations
   * Admin users have write access to all jobs
   * Admin users have write access to admin operations

If security is disabled all users are admin users.

Oozie security is set via the following configuration property (default value shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.AuthorizationService.security.enabled=false
</verbatim>

NOTE: the old ACL model where a group was provided is still supported if the following property is set
in =oozie-site.xml=:

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.AuthorizationService.default.group.as.acl=true
</verbatim>

Admin users are determined from the list of admin groups, specified in
 =oozie.service.AuthorizationService.admin.groups= property. Use commas to separate multiple groups, spaces, tabs
and ENTER characters are trimmed.

If the above property for admin groups is not set, then the admin users are the users specified in the
 =conf/adminusers.txt= file. The syntax of this file is:

   * One user name per line
   * Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored

---+++ Oozie System ID Configuration

Oozie has a system ID that is is used to generate the Oozie temporary runtime directory, the workflow job IDs, and the
workflow action IDs.

Two Oozie systems running with the same ID will not have any conflict but in case of troubleshooting it will be easier
to identify resources created/used by the different Oozie systems if they have different system IDs (default value
shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.system.id=oozie-${user.name}
</verbatim>

---+++ Filesystem Configuration

Oozie lets you to configure the allowed Filesystems by using the following configuration property in oozie-site.xml:
<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.supported.filesystems</name>
    <value>hdfs</value>
  </property>
</verbatim>

The above value, =hdfs=, which is the default, means that Oozie will only allow HDFS filesystems to be used.  Examples of other
filesystems that Oozie is compatible with are: hdfs, hftp, webhdfs, and viewfs.  Multiple filesystems can be specified as
comma-separated values.  Putting a * will allow any filesystem type, effectively disabling this check.

---+++ HCatalog Configuration

Refer to the [[DG_HCatalogIntegration][Oozie HCatalog Integration]] document for a overview of HCatalog and
integration of Oozie with HCatalog. This section explains the various settings to be configured in oozie-site.xml on
the Oozie server to enable Oozie to work with HCatalog.

*Adding HCatalog jars to Oozie war:*

 For Oozie server to talk to HCatalog server, HCatalog and hive jars need to be in the server classpath.
hive-site.xml which has the configuration to talk to the HCatalog server also needs to be in the classpath.

The oozie-[version]-hcataloglibs.tar.gz in the oozie distribution bundles the required hcatalog and hive jars that
needs to be placed in the Oozie server classpath. If using a version of HCatalog bundled in
Oozie hcataloglibs/, copy the corresponding HCatalog jars from hcataloglibs/ to the libext/ directory. If using a
different version of HCatalog, copy the required HCatalog jars from such version in the libext/ directory.
This needs to be done before running the =oozie-setup.sh= script so that these jars get added to the Oozie WAR file.

*Configure HCatalog URI Handling:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.URIHandlerService.uri.handlers</name>
    <value>org.apache.oozie.dependency.FSURIHandler,org.apache.oozie.dependency.HCatURIHandler</value>
    <description>
        Enlist the different uri handlers supported for data availability checks.
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

The above configuration defines the different uri handlers which check for existence of data dependencies defined in a
Coordinator. The default value is =org.apache.oozie.dependency.FSURIHandler=. FSURIHandler supports uris with
schemes defined in the configuration =oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.supported.filesystems= which are hdfs, hftp
and webhcat by default. HCatURIHandler supports uris with the scheme as hcat.

*Configure HCatalog services:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.services.ext</name>
    <value>
        org.apache.oozie.service.JMSAccessorService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.PartitionDependencyManagerService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.HCatAccessorService
      </value>
    <description>
          To add/replace services defined in 'oozie.services' with custom implementations.
          Class names must be separated by commas.
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

PartitionDependencyManagerService and HCatAccessorService are required to work with HCatalog and support Coordinators
having HCatalog uris as data dependency. If the HCatalog server is configured to publish partition availability
notifications to a JMS compliant messaging provider like ActiveMQ, then JMSAccessorService needs to be added
to =oozie.services.ext= to handle those notifications.

*Configure JMS Provider JNDI connection mapping for HCatalog:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.HCatAccessorService.jmsconnections</name>
    <value>
      hcat://hcatserver.colo1.com:8020=java.naming.factory.initial#Dummy.Factory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.colo1.com:61616,
      default=java.naming.factory.initial#org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.colo.com:61616;connectionFactoryNames#ConnectionFactory
    </value>
    <description>
        Specify the map  of endpoints to JMS configuration properties. In general, endpoint
        identifies the HCatalog server URL. "default" is used if no endpoint is mentioned
        in the query. If some JMS property is not defined, the system will use the property
        defined jndi.properties. jndi.properties files is retrieved from the application classpath.
        Mapping rules can also be provided for mapping Hcatalog servers to corresponding JMS providers.
        hcat://${1}.${2}.com:8020=java.naming.factory.initial#Dummy.Factory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.${2}.com:61616
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

  Currently HCatalog does not provide APIs to get the connection details to connect to the JMS Provider it publishes
notifications to. It only has APIs which provide the topic name in the JMS Provider to which the notifications are
published for a given database table. So the JMS Provider's connection properties needs to be manually configured
in Oozie using the above setting. You can either provide a =default= JNDI configuration which will be used as the
JMS Provider for all HCatalog servers, or can specify a configuration per HCatalog server URL or provide a
configuration based on a rule matching multiple HCatalog server URLs. For example: With the configuration of
hcat://${1}.${2}.com:8020=java.naming.factory.initial#Dummy.Factory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://broker.${2}.com:61616,
request URL of hcat://server1.colo1.com:8020 will map to tcp://broker.colo1.com:61616, hcat://server2.colo2.com:8020
will map to tcp://broker.colo2.com:61616 and so on.

*Configure HCatalog Polling Frequency:*

<verbatim>
  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.coord.push.check.requeue.interval
        </name>
    <value>600000</value>
    <description>Command re-queue interval for push dependencies (in millisecond).
    </description>
  </property>
</verbatim>

  If there is no JMS Provider configured for a HCatalog Server, then oozie polls HCatalog based on the frequency defined
in =oozie.service.coord.input.check.requeue.interval=. This config also applies to HDFS polling.
If there is a JMS provider configured for a HCatalog Server, then oozie polls HCatalog based on the frequency defined
in =oozie.service.coord.push.check.requeue.interval= as a fallback.
The defaults for =oozie.service.coord.input.check.requeue.interval= and =oozie.service.coord.push.check.requeue.interval=
are 1 minute and 10 minutes respectively.

---+++ Notifications Configuration

Oozie supports publishing notifications to a JMS Provider for job status changes and SLA met and miss events. For
more information on the feature, refer [[DG_JMSNotifications][JMS Notifications]] documentation. Oozie can also send email
notifications on SLA misses.

   * *Message Broker Installation*: <br/>
For Oozie to send/receive messages, a JMS-compliant broker should be installed. Apache ActiveMQ is a popular JMS-compliant
broker usable for this purpose. See [[http://activemq.apache.org/getting-started.html][here]] for instructions on
installing and running ActiveMQ.

   * *Services*: <br/>
Add/modify =oozie.services.ext= property in =oozie-site.xml= to include the following services.
     <verbatim>
     <property>
        <name>oozie.services.ext</name>
        <value>
            org.apache.oozie.service.JMSAccessorService,
            org.apache.oozie.service.JMSTopicService,
            org.apache.oozie.service.EventHandlerService,
            org.apache.oozie.sla.service.SLAService
        </value>
     </property>
     </verbatim>

   * *Event Handlers*: <br/>
   <verbatim>
     <property>
        <name>oozie.service.EventHandlerService.event.listeners</name>
        <value>
            org.apache.oozie.jms.JMSJobEventListener,
            org.apache.oozie.sla.listener.SLAJobEventListener,
            org.apache.oozie.jms.JMSSLAEventListener,
            org.apache.oozie.sla.listener.SLAEmailEventListener
        </value>
     </property>
     </verbatim>
    It is also recommended to increase =oozie.service.SchedulerService.threads= to 15 for faster event processing and sending notifications. The services and their functions are as follows: <br/>
      JMSJobEventListener - Sends JMS job notifications <br/>
      JMSSLAEventListener - Sends JMS SLA notifications <br/>
      SLAEmailEventListener - Sends Email SLA notifications <br/>
      SLAJobEventListener - Processes job events and calculates SLA. Does not send any notifications
   * *JMS properties*:  <br/>
Add =oozie.jms.producer.connection.properties= property in =oozie-site.xml=. Its value corresponds to an
identifier (e.g. default) assigned to a semi-colon separated key#value list of properties from your JMS broker's
=jndi.properties= file. The important properties are =java.naming.factory.initial= and =java.naming.provider.url=.

     As an example, if using ActiveMQ in local env, the property can be set to
     <verbatim>
     <property>
        <name>oozie.jms.producer.connection.properties</name>
        <value>
            java.naming.factory.initial#org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory;java.naming.provider.url#tcp://localhost:61616;connectionFactoryNames#ConnectionFactory
        </value>
     </property>
     </verbatim>
   * *JMS Topic name*: <br/>
JMS consumers listen on a particular "topic". Hence Oozie needs to define a topic variable with which to publish messages
about the various jobs.
     <verbatim>
     <property>
        <name>oozie.service.JMSTopicService.topic.name</name>
        <value>
            default=${username}
        </value>
        <description>
            Topic options are ${username}, ${jobId}, or a fixed string which can be specified as default or for a
            particular job type.
            For e.g To have a fixed string topic for workflows, coordinators and bundles,
            specify in the following comma-separated format: {jobtype1}={some_string1}, {jobtype2}={some_string2}
            where job type can be WORKFLOW, COORDINATOR or BUNDLE.
            Following example defines topic for workflow job, workflow action, coordinator job, coordinator action,
            bundle job and bundle action
            WORKFLOW=workflow,
            COORDINATOR=coordinator,
            BUNDLE=bundle
            For jobs with no defined topic, default topic will be ${username}
        </description>
     </property>
     </verbatim>

     Another related property is the topic prefix.
     <verbatim>
     <property>
        <name>oozie.service.JMSTopicService.topic.prefix</name>
        <value></value>
        <description>
            This can be used to append a prefix to the topic in oozie.service.JMSTopicService.topic.name. For eg: oozie.
        </description>
     </property>
     </verbatim>


---+++ Setting Up Oozie with HTTPS (SSL)

*IMPORTANT*:
The default HTTPS configuration will cause all Oozie URLs to use HTTPS except for the JobTracker callback URLs. This is to simply
configuration (no changes needed outside of Oozie), but this is okay because Oozie doesn't inherently trust the callbacks anyway;
they are used as hints.

The related environment variables are explained at [[AG_Install#Environment_Setup][Environment Setup]].

You can use either a certificate from a Certificate Authority or a Self-Signed Certificate.  Using a self-signed certificate
requires some additional configuration on each Oozie client machine.

---++++To use a Self-Signed Certificate
There are many ways to create a Self-Signed Certificate, this is just one way.  We will be using the keytool program, which is
included with your JRE. If its not on your path, you should be able to find it in $JAVA_HOME/bin.

1. Run the following command (as the Oozie user); you will be asked a series of questions in an interactive prompt.  It will create
the keystore file, which will be named =.keystore= and located in the Oozie user's home directory.
<verbatim>
keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA
</verbatim>
The password you enter for "keystore password" and "key password for <tomcat>" must be the same; Oozie is configued to use
"password" by default. If you want to use a password other than "password", you will need to change the =OOZIE_HTTPS_KEYSTORE_PASS=
environment variable.
The answer to "What is your first and last name?" (i.e. "CN") must be the hostname of the machine where the Oozie Server will be
running.

2. Run the following command (as the Oozie user) to export a certificate file from the keystore file:
<verbatim>
keytool -exportcert -alias tomcat -file path/to/where/I/want/my/certificate.cert
</verbatim>

---++++To use a Certificate from a Certificate Authority

1. You will need to make a request to a Certificate Authority in order to obtain a proper Certificate; please consult a Certificate
Authority on this procedure.

2. Once you have your .cert file, run the following command (as the Oozie user) to create a keystore file from your certificate:
<verbatim>
keytool -import -alias tomcat -file path/to/certificate.cert
</verbatim>
The keystore file will be named =.keystore= and located in the Oozie user's home directory.

---++++Configure the Oozie Server to use SSL (HTTPS)

1. Make sure the Oozie server isn't running

2. Run the following command (as the Oozie user):
<verbatim>
oozie-setup.sh prepare-war -secure
</verbatim>
This will configure Oozie to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.  To revert back to HTTP, simply rerun the command without =-secure=.

3. Start the Oozie server

---++++Configure the Oozie Client to connect using SSL (HTTPS)

The first two steps are only necessary if you are using a Self-Signed Certificate; the third is required either way.
Also, these steps must be done on every machine where you intend to use the Oozie Client.

1. Copy or download the .cert file onto the client machine

2. Run the following command (as root) to import the certificate into the JRE's keystore. This will allow any Java program,
including the Oozie client, to connect to the Oozie Server using your self-signed certificate.
<verbatim>
sudo keytool -import -alias tomcat -file path/to/certificate.cert -keystore ${JRE_cacerts}
</verbatim>
Where ${JRE_cacerts} is the path to the JRE's certs file.  It's location may differ depending on the Operating System, but its
typically called cacerts and located at ${JAVA_HOME}/lib/security/cacerts but may be under a different directory in ${JAVA_HOME}
(you may want to create a backup copy of this file first). The default password is =changeit=.

3. When using the Oozie Client, you will need to use https://oozie.server.hostname:11443/oozie instead of
http://oozie.server.hostname:11000/oozie -- Java will not automatically redirect from the http address to the https address.

---++++Connect to the Oozie Web UI using SSL (HTTPS)

1. Use https://oozie.server.hostname:11443/oozie
though most browsers should automatically redirect you if you use http://oozie.server.hostname:11000/oozie

*IMPORTANT*: If using a Self-Signed Certificate, your browser will warn you that it can't verify the certificate or something
similar. You will probably have to add your certificate as an exception.

---+++ Fine Tuning an Oozie Server

Refer to the [[./oozie-default.xml][oozie-default.xml]] for details.

#HA
---+++ High Availability (HA)

Multiple Oozie Servers can be configured against the same database to provide High Availability (HA) of the Oozie service.

---++++ Pre-requisites

1. A database that supports multiple concurrent connections.  In order to have full HA, the database should also have HA support, or
it becomes a single point of failure.

*NOTE:* The default derby database does not support this

2. A ZooKeeper ensemble.

Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for distributed applications; the Oozie servers use it for
coordinating access to the database and communicating with each other.  In order to have full HA, there should be at least 3
ZooKeeper servers.
More information on ZooKeeper can be found [[http://zookeeper.apache.org][here]].

3. Multiple Oozie servers.

*IMPORTANT:* While not strictly required for all configuration properties, all of the servers should ideally have exactly the same
configuration for consistency's sake.

4. A Loadbalancer, Virtual IP, or Round-Robin DNS.

This is used to provide a single entry-point for users and for callbacks from the JobTracker.  The load balancer should be
configured for round-robin between the Oozie servers to distribute the requests.  Users (using either the Oozie client, a web
browser, or the REST API) should connect through the load balancer.  In order to have full HA, the load balancer should also have
HA support, or it becomes a single point of failure.

---++++ Installation/Configuration Steps

1. Install identically configured Oozie servers normally.  Make sure they are all configured against the same database and make sure
that you DO NOT start them yet.

2. Add the following services to the extension services configuration property in oozie-site.xml in all Oozie servers.  This will
make Oozie use the ZooKeeper versions of these services instead of the default implementations.

<verbatim>
<property>
    <name>oozie.services.ext</name>
    <value>
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKLocksService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKXLogStreamingService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKJobsConcurrencyService
    </value>
</property>
</verbatim>

3. Add the following property to oozie-site.xml in all Oozie servers.  It should be a comma-separated list of host:port pairs of the
ZooKeeper servers.  The default value is shown below.

<verbatim>
<property>
   <name>oozie.zookeeper.connection.string</name>
   <value>localhost:2181</value>
</property>
</verbatim>

4. (Optional) Add the following property to oozie-site.xml in all Oozie servers to specify the namespace to use.  All of the Oozie
Servers that are planning on talking to each other should have the same namespace.  If there are multiple Oozie setups each doing
their own HA, they should have their own namespace.  The default value is shown below.

<verbatim>
<property>
    <name>oozie.zookeeper.namespace</name>
    <value>oozie</value>
</property>
</verbatim>

5. Change the value of OOZIE_BASE_URL in oozie-env.sh to point to the loadbalancer or virtual IP, for example:

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_BASE_URL="http://my.loadbalancer.hostname:11000/oozie"
</verbatim>

6. (Optional) Change the value of OOZIE_INSTANCE_ID in oozie-env.sh.  Each Oozie server should have its own unique instance id.  The
default is =${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}= (i.e. the hostname).

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_INSTANCE_ID="${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}"
</verbatim>

7. Start the ZooKeeper servers.

8. Start the Oozie servers.

Note: If one of the Oozie servers becomes unavailable, querying Oozie for the logs from a job in the Web UI, REST API, or client may
be missing information until that server comes back up.

---++++ Security

Oozie HA works with the existing Oozie security framework and settings. For log streaming to work properly in a secure
setup =oozie.authentication.type= must be set properly on each server (though this is already required if using security in the
first place).

(Optional) To prevent unauthorized users or programs from interacting with or reading the znodes used by Oozie in ZooKeeper,
you can tell Oozie to use Kerberos-backed ACLs.  To enforce this for all of the Oozie-related znodes, simply add the following
property to oozie-site.xml in all Oozie servers and set it to =true=.  The default is =false=.

<verbatim>
<property>
    <name>oozie.zookeeper.secure</name>
    <value>true</value>
</property>
</verbatim>

Note: The Kerberos principals of each of the Oozie servers should have the same primary name (i.e. in =primary/instance@REALM=, each
server should have the same value for =primary=).

*Important:* Once this property is set to =true=, it will set the ACLs on all existing Oozie-related znodes to only allow Kerberos
authenticated users with a principal that has the same primary as described above (also for any subsequently created new znodes).
This means that if you ever want to turn this feature off, you will have to manually connect to ZooKeeper using a Kerberos principal
with the same primary and either delete all znodes under and including the namespace (i.e. if =oozie.zookeeper.namespace= = =oozie=
then that would be =/oozie=); alternatively, instead of deleting them all, you can manually set all of their ACLs to =world:anyone=.
In either case, make sure that no Oozie servers are running while this is being done.

Also, in your zoo.cfg for ZooKeeper, make sure to set the following properties:
<verbatim>
authProvider.1=org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider
kerberos.removeHostFromPrincipal=true
kerberos.removeRealmFromPrincipal=true
</verbatim>

---++ Starting and Stopping Oozie

Use the standard Tomcat commands to start and stop Oozie.

---++ Oozie Command Line Installation

Copy and expand the =oozie-client= TAR.GZ file bundled with the distribution. Add the =bin/= directory to the =PATH=.

Refer to the [[DG_CommandLineTool][Command Line Interface Utilities]] document for a a full reference of the =oozie=
command line tool.

---++ Oozie Share Lib

The Oozie sharelib TAR.GZ file bundled with the distribution contains the necessary files to run Oozie map-reduce streaming, pig,
hive, sqooop, and distcp actions.  There is also a sharelib for HCatalog.  The sharelib is required for these actions to work; any
other actions (mapreduce, shell, ssh, and java) do not require the sharelib to be installed.

As of Oozie 4.0, the following property is included.  If true, Oozie will create and ship a "launcher jar" to hdfs that contains
classes necessary for the launcher job.  If false, Oozie will not do this, and it is assumed that the necessary classes are in their
respective sharelib jars or the "oozie" sharelib instead.  When false, the sharelib is required for ALL actions; when true, the
sharelib is only required for actions that need additional jars (the original list from above).

<verbatim>
<property>
    <name>oozie.action.ship.launcher.jar</name>
    <value>true</value>
</property>
</verbatim>

Using sharelib CLI, sharelib files are copied to new lib_<timestamped> directory. At start, server picks the sharelib from latest
time-stamp directory. While starting, server also purges sharelib directory which are older than sharelib retention days
(defined as oozie.service.ShareLibService.temp.sharelib.retention.days and 7 days is default).

Sharelib mapping file can be also configured. Configured file is a key value mapping, where key will be the sharelib name for the
action and value is a comma separated list of DFS directories or jar files.
 This can be configured in oozie-site.xml as :
 <verbatim>
  <!-- OOZIE -->
    <property>
        <name>oozie.service.ShareLibService.mapping.file</name>
        <value></value>
        <description>
            Sharelib mapping files contains list of key=value,
            where key will be the sharelib name for the action and value is a comma separated list of
            DFS directories or jar files.
            Example.
            oozie.pig_10=hdfs:///share/lib/pig/pig-0.10.1/lib/
            oozie.pig=hdfs:///share/lib/pig/pig-0.11.1/lib/
            oozie.distcp=hdfs:///share/lib/hadoop-2.2.0/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-distcp-2.2.0.jar
        </description>
    </property>
 </verbatim>


---++ Oozie Coordinators/Bundles Processing Timezone

By default Oozie runs coordinator and bundle jobs using =UTC= timezone for datetime values specified in the application
XML and in the job parameter properties. This includes coordinator applications start and end times of jobs, coordinator
datasets initial-instance, bundle applications kick-offtimes. In addition, coordinator dataset instance URI templates
will be resolved using datetime values of the Oozie processing timezone.

It is possible to set the Oozie processing timezone to a timezone that is an offset of UTC, alternate timezones must
expressed in using a GMT offset ( =GMT+/-####= ). For example: =GMT+0530= (India timezone).

To change the default =UTC= timezone, use the =oozie.processing.timezone= property in the =oozie-site.xml=. For example:

<verbatim>
<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>oozie.processing.timezone</name>
        <value>GMT+0530</value>
    </property>
</configuration>
</verbatim>

*IMPORTANT:* If using a processing timezone other than =UTC=, all datetime values in coordinator and bundle jobs must
be expressed in the corresponding timezone, for example =2012-08-08T12:42+0530=.

*NOTE:* It is strongly encouraged to use =UTC=, the default Oozie processing timezone.

For more details on using an alternate Oozie processing timezone, please reffer to the
[[CoordinatorFunctionalSpec#datetime][Coordinator Fuctional Specification, section '4. Datetime']]

#UberJar
---++ MapReduce Workflow Uber Jars
For Map-Reduce jobs (not including streaming or pipes), additional jar files can also be included via an uber jar. An uber jar is a
jar file that contains additional jar files within a "lib" folder (see
[[WorkflowFunctionalSpec#AppDeployment][Workflow Functional Specification]] for more information). Submitting a workflow with an uber jar
requires at least Hadoop 2.2.0 or 1.2.0. As such, using uber jars in a workflow is disabled by default. To enable this feature, use
the =oozie.action.mapreduce.uber.jar.enable= property in the =oozie-site.xml= (and make sure to use a supported version of Hadoop).

<verbatim>
<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>oozie.action.mapreduce.uber.jar.enable</name>
        <value>true</value>
    </property>
</configuration>
</verbatim>

---++ Advanced/Custom Environment Settings

Oozie can be configured to use Unix standard filesystem hierarchy for its different files
(configuration, logs, data and temporary files).

These settings must be done in the =bin/oozie-env.sh= script.

This script is sourced before the configuration =oozie-env.sh= and supports additional
environment variables (shown with their default values):

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_CONFIG=${OOZIE_HOME}/conf
export OOZIE_DATA={OOZIE_HOME}/data
export OOZIE_LOG={OOZIE_HOME}/logs
export CATALINA_BASE=${OOZIE_HOME}/oozie-server
export CATALINA_TMPDIR=${OOZIE_HOME}/oozie-server/temp
export CATALINA_OUT=${OOZIE_LOGS}/catalina.out
export CATALINA_PID=/tmp/oozie.pid
</verbatim>

Sample values to make Oozie follow Unix standard filesystem hierarchy:

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_CONFIG=/etc/oozie
export OOZIE_DATA=/var/lib/oozie
export OOZIE_LOG=/var/log/oozie
export CATALINA_BASE=${OOZIE_DATA}/oozie-server
export CATALINA_TMPDIR=/tmp
export CATALINA_PID=/tmp/oozie.pid
</verbatim>
