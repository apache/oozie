     * Creates and sets up the embedded ZooKeeper server.  Test subclasses should have no reason to override this method.
     * <p>
     * Here we override it to start the MiniKdc, set the jaas configuration, configure ZooKeeper for SASL/Kerberos authentication
     * and ACLs, and to start the ZooKeeper server.
     * <p>
     * Unfortunately, ZooKeeper security requires setting the security for the entire JVM.  And for the tests, we're running the
     * ZK server and one or more clients from the same JVM, so things get messy.  There are two ways to tell ZooKeeper to
     * authenticate: (1) set the system property, "java.security.auth.login.config", to a jaas.conf file and (2) create a
     * javax.security.auth.login.Configuration object with the same info as the jaas.conf and set it.  In either case, once set and
     * something has authenticated, it seems that it can't be unset or changed, and there's no way to log out.  By setting the
     * system property, "javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly", to "false" we can sort-of change the jaas Configuration, but its
     * kind of funny about it.  Another effect of this is that we have to add jaas entries for the "Server" and "Client" here
     * instead of just the "Server" here and the "Client" in the normal place ({@link ZKUtils}) or it will be unable to find the
     * "Client" info.  Also, because there is no way to logout, once any client has authenticated once, all subsequent clients will
     * automatically connect using the same authentication; trying to stop this is futile and either results in an error or has no
     * effect.  This means that there's no way to do any tests with an unauthenticated client.  Also, if any tests using secure
     * ZooKeeper get run before tests not using secure ZooKeeper, they will likely fail because it will try to use authentication:
     * so they should be run separately.
